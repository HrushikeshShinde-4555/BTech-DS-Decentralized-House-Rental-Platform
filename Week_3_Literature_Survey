LITERATURE SURVEY

• For almost 17 years, “bdHousing.com” has held the dominating position of of fering a traditional 
and well-accepted stage for property owners to promote their assets for rent or sale, as well as 
allowing property seekers to discover their dream house. As a result, it is now known as 
Bangladesh’s largest online proper ty selling website .

• “Renthome” is an internet marketplace that assists individuals in finding land, a cheap home, or 
business space. Their goal is to provide our valued clients with the most up-to-date marketing 
information and make it as easy as possible for them to contact brokers, developers, and landlords. 
As Bangladesh’s leading rea- dy-to-buy-and-sell platform, they’ve designed their system to provide 
you with as much information on your preferred property as possible at any moment .  

• The famous Bangladeshi largest market place “Bikroy.com” has a partial sec tion for house rent or 
buy-sell. Since then, the system has worked as a place to buy and sell used items.

• Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool to reimagine digital trust, data ownership, 
and peer-to-peer interactions. Several research studies and industry reports suggest that 
blockchain’s decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature can solve many challenges 
associated with centralized systems. 

• Ethereum-based protocols have been explored for their ability to record rental terms, enforce 
time-bound agreements, and enable programmable deposits and refunds.

REVIEW OF EXISTING SYSTEM(s):

In the current real estate rental ecosystem, most transactions are facilitated through centralized 
platforms such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Zillow Rentals, and traditional property management 
software. These systems act as intermediaries between property owners and tenants by handling 
listings, payments, reviews, and conflict resolution. While they have simplified the rental process 
and enabled wide-scale digital adoption, they are heavily reliant on centralized databases and 
authorities to validate, manage, and store data. 

Airbnb, for example, provides users with a convenient interface to search for short-term rental 
properties, make payments, and leave reviews. However, all listings, transactions, user data, and 
reviews are stored and managed by Airbnb, giving it full control over the platform’s operation. 
Similarly, Booking.com and Vrbo offer broad rental options but follow the same centralized 
governance model, which raises concerns around fairness, censorship, and fees.Traditional rental 
management systems used by real estate agencies and landlords also rely on centralized web 
services for contract storage, tenant screening, rent payment, and complaint management. These 
systems require trust in the service provider for security and fairness. 

Emerging platforms like Rentberry and Propy have attempted to introduce partial 
decentralization by integrating blockchain elements such as token payments or smart contracts. 
However, many still operate within hybrid frameworks where core services (like dispute 
resolution, reviews, and KYC) are controlled centrally. 

These systems, while functional, continue to exhibit limitations related to transparency, costs, data 
security, and reliance on third parties. 

LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING SYSTEM(S):

The existing systems for house rental in Bangladesh, such as bdHousing.com, Renthome, and 
Bikroy.com, despite being popular and widely used, exhibit several critical limitations that prevent 
them from fully addressing the modern needs of renters and property owners. These systems are 
primarily centralized platforms, meaning they rely on a single entity to manage data, transactions, 
and interactions between parties. This centralization introduces several challenges that hinder 
transparency, efficiency, and security within the house rental process. 

One of the fundamental issues with existing platforms is the lack of transparency in their 
operations. Pricing models and the terms of rental agreements are often opaque, leaving both 
tenants and landlords uncertain about the actual costs involved. The absence of clear pricing 
breakdowns and service charges can lead to misunderstandings, resulting in dissatisfied users. 
Furthermore, because these platforms control all data, there is a risk of information manipulation 
or selective promotion of listings, often favoring specific properties or real estate developers for 
financial or marketing reasons. This lack of independent verification of listing details undermines 
trust and increases the potential for fraudulent activities. 

Another significant limitation is the dependence on intermediaries, such as brokers, agents, and 
platform administrators, to facilitate key aspects of the rental process, including communication, 
payments, and contract management. These intermediaries add layers of complexity, which 
increase the costs of using the platform due to high service fees and commission charges. 
Additionally, this reliance results in delays in processing payments and finalizing rental 
agreements, which creates frustration for both parties involved. The manual nature of these 
transactions also means that users have limited control over the process, making the system less 
efficient and more prone to human error or delays. 

Overall, the limitations of current centralized house rental systems in Bangladesh are clear. They 
rely heavily on intermediaries, suffer from data privacy issues, lack transparency, and provide 
minimal user control or automation. These issues create inefficiencies and barriers to a more 
secure, transparent, and fair rental process. Therefore, there is a growing demand for a 
decentralized solution that leverages blockchain technology to address these shortcomings by 
automating processes, ensuring data security, reducing costs, and offering a more transparent and 
user-controlled environment for both landlords and tenants. 

In this context, a blockchain-based decentralized house rental platform can significantly improve 
the rental experience by eliminating intermediaries, ensuring tamper-proof records, automating 
rental agreements and payments through smart contracts, and providing users with control over 
their own data and reputation. Such a platform would offer increased trust, improved efficiency, 
and reduced costs, making it a much-needed alternative to the limitations posed by centralized 
systems.
