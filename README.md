# Decentralized House Rental Platform
# Abstract
Block chain innovation is a key instrument that performing in transactions. Block chain has got
an impressive consideration from private and government foundation. This paper is to present
the block chain agreement for a particular domain which is genuine. A definite Structure
of agreement is exhibited and an utilization case for leasing private and Business Structures
analyzed. This report proposes a blockchain-based solution for housing rental system to achieve
peer-to-peer sharing of listings information in an intermediary-free manner. The new solution
programmatically converts traditional lease agreements into smart lease contracts, improve the
efficiency of the leasing process, and store transaction records for the leasing process to provide
legal protection for tenants and landlords. The emerging technologies, including smart contract
and IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) are exploited in the new system. IPFS is used to store
listings information. The Ethereumâ€™s Smart Contract is used to manage the hash of IPFS
listings information, and a smart lease contract is written to make the housing rental process
traceable and visible.
Over the years house rental agents and landlords have had problems in maintaining their tenants
records. The management of tenants records and properties has become difficult as a result of
data growth, lack of computerized system, data security, etc. Also, due to population growth
and metropolitan migration the manual-based techniques used in keeping records of tenants
are prone to error and lot of time is wasted by the prospective tenant in looking for a house to
rent. As a result of these, a secured cloud-based house rental management system was designed.
This system assists prospective tenants in getting house with ease, help landlord/agent manage
tenants issues and also facilitate communication between tenant and landlords/agents. We
introduce a decentralized platform for the home-sharing economy facilitating short and long
term stays payable with cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods. We are building
a decentralized version of Airbnb . For sites like Airbnb, Blockchain is very useful. This is
because it is capable of storing peoples online identities. This enables people to easily check
if you are a trusted host by checking the ID number associated with your account. We are
removing complete control of Airbnb We have built an Decentralized AirBnB that incorporates
three main functionality ,Rent OUT your Space, View Available Space , Rent A Space From
someone
