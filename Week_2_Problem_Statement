PROBLEM STATEMENT

The house rental market has undergone a significant transformation in the digital age, with 
centralized online platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo making it easier than ever to connect 
property owners with prospective tenants. These platforms have provided convenience, global reach, 
and streamlined booking processes. However, their centralized nature introduces several inherent 
challenges that impact trust, efficiency, and fairness in the rental ecosystem. 

One of the most pressing issues is the lack of transparency in operations. Centralized rental platforms 
control listing visibility, pricing algorithms, transaction records, and review systems. This opaque 
environment gives the platform disproportionate power, enabling it to manipulate information, 
impose non-transparent service charges, and prioritize certain listings for profit motives rather than 
merit. As a result, both renters and property owners often operate under unclear conditions, with 
limited insight into how decisions are made or disputes are resolved. 

Another critical concern is the high service fees charged by these platforms. Intermediary fees often 
range from 10% to 30% of the total rental cost. These fees reduce earnings for property owners and 
increase expenses for tenants, making rentals less accessible and equitable. These charges are 
primarily used to maintain centralized servers, manage user data, and mediate disputes—all of which 
can potentially be handled more efficiently through decentralized solutions. 

Moreover, centralized systems are vulnerable to data breaches and misuse of user information. User 
profiles, financial data, transaction history, and private communications are stored on centralized 
servers, which are attractive targets for hackers. Even without malicious intent, platforms can exploit 
user data for targeted advertising, sell it to third parties, or impose data restrictions that limit user 
autonomy. 

Trust issues also persist. Many users have experienced fraudulent listings, misleading descriptions, 
or dishonest reviews. The review system, often regarded as a core feature of centralized platforms, 
can be manipulated through fake accounts or filtered feedback. Users are expected to trust a 
platform’s internal moderation process, which is often biased, inconsistent, or unresponsive in cases 
of disputes. 

Furthermore, cross-border transactions and payments introduce additional complexities such as 
currency conversion fees, delays in fund transfers, and jurisdictional restrictions. This hampers the 
ability of property owners and tenants to engage in seamless global rentals, especially in regions with 
limited access to modern banking infrastructure. 

This project aims to develop a Decentralized House Rental Platform using blockchain to enable 
transparent listings, automated rental agreements, immutable records, and direct payments. By 
shifting from a platform-centric to a user-centric model, this system will improve trust, enhance 
security, reduce costs, and democratize access to rental services globally.


OBJECTIVES OF WORK

The main objective of this project is to develop a Decentralized House Rental Platform that 
utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and direct transactions between 
property owners and tenants without the need for centralized intermediaries.
The detailed objectives of the project are as follows: 

1. To design a blockchain-based architecture that supports peer-to-peer rental transactions 
using smart contracts. 
2. To develop and implement smart contracts that automate rental agreements, payments, 
security deposits, and refund mechanisms. 
3. To ensure transparency and immutability of rental records, user interactions, and reviews 
through blockchain integration. 
4. To reduce dependency on centralized platforms and eliminate high intermediary fees and 
unfair policies. 
5. To provide secure, borderless payment options using cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. 
6. To empower users with data ownership and decentralized identity (DID), allowing them 
full control over their personal information and reputations. 
7. To build a user-friendly interface for listing, searching, and booking properties in a 
decentralized environment. 
8. To introduce a fair and decentralized dispute resolution mechanism using smart 
contracts or community voting protocols. 

Through these objectives, the project aims to build a trustless, efficient, and user-controlled 
alternative to conventional house rental systems.
